Description: Provides tools for automated extraction and analysis of RGB color data 
    from scanned leaf disc images. The package implements circular disc masking, 
    automatic background filtering, and quantification of green vs. brown color 
    proportions. Designed for thermal tolerance experiments where leaf discs are 
    subjected to different temperature treatments and color changes indicate stress 
    responses. Supports bulk processing of multiple scans with automatic metadata 
    extraction from filenames. Created by Rakesh Tiwari at the Centre for Climate 
    Change Research, with support for advanced photosynthesis thermal tolerance studies.
